# japan_website
Website created for my highschool computer science certificate.
I chose to make this site about Japan because it is a country that I am passionate about. Thus, I tried to present some of Japanâ€™s culture, traditions, curiosities and main attractions. The role of this site is to help people get informed about what they can visit, what activities they can do and reasons for planning a future trip to this country.
